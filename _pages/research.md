Climate change is the defining issue facing our generation and generations to come. Its underlying cause is clear - accumulated greenhouse gases, emitted from fossil fuel exploitation, absorb infrared radiation and cause global warming. However, a large but highly uncertain fraction of the warming has been *masked* by atmospheric aerosol particles, via their direct effect of reflecting incoming solar radiation and indirect effect of serving as seeds for cloud formation.

This uncertainty in the aerosol forcing is rooted in the unknown baseline aerosol state of the preindustrial atmosphere, and the poorly understood mechanisms driving the anthropogenic increase in aerosols and clouds to date. Our research aims to address this uncertainty and provide novel approaches to (a) constrain the oxidative chemistry of emerging pollutants for particle nucleation, (b) resolve microphysical processes in particle growth and survival, and (c) develop a particle dynamics model with experimental and meteorological inputs for real-world deployment.

### Oxidative chemistry and product volatility
While our ambient measurements and laboratory experiments have show that present- day nucleation in cities may be dominated by sulfuric acid, the importance of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) for urban nucleation is likely to increase in the future as clean energy pledges continue to reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions sharply. I revealed that photoxidation of some AVOCs may be especially effective at producing low-volatility products that drive particle formation. My results have provided a reference guide on volatility parameterizations to several subsequent ambient studies. However, AVOCs oxidation mechanisms have challenged atmospheric kineticists for decades. Therefore, the first project will focus on the oxidation of traditional (e.g. benzene) and emerging (e.g. phenoxyethanol) AVOCs, constraining their chemical mechanism and product volatility distribution.
