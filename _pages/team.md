**Principal Investigator**

I am an atmospheric scientist focusing on aerosol particle formation and its impact on air quality and climate change. Before joining UChicago, I was a [Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellow/mingyi-wang/) at Caltech, where I worked on aerosol microphysics in the upper atmosphere using aircraft measurements. I received my Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied the chemical mechanisms that drive particle formation in various environments. My research was recognized with the [Sheldon K. Friedlander Award](https://www.aaar.org/awards/annual-awards/sheldon-k-friedlander-award/) from the American Association for Aerosol Research ([Curriculum Vitae]()).
